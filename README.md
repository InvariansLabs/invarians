# Invarians

Invarians is a neutral instrument that captures and compresses structural signals emitted by blockchain-based systems over time.

It does not analyze, evaluate, or interpret those systems.
It preserves structural context.

---

## What Invarians is

Invarians observes procedural signals produced by blockchain execution over time.
These signals describe order, cadence, density, and temporal continuity of execution.

They are captured and compressed into bounded structural forms called **InKe** (Invariant Kernels).

Invarians is an observatory.
It does not act on the systems it observes.

---

## What is captured

- Procedural execution order and finality
- Structural density and compositional complexity
- Temporal cadence and rhythm
- Continuity across bounded time intervals

---

## How signals are compressed

Structural signals are compressed using explicit arithmetic relationships and geometric reduction.

- No statistical modeling
- No weighting
- No semantic interpretation
- No optimization

Compression preserves proportional relationships and temporal continuity only.

---

## What is not captured

- Economic value or price variation
- Actor identity or intent
- Sentiment, utility, or performance
- Risk, correctness, or validity assertions

---

## InKe (Invariant Kernel)

An **InKe** is a bounded structural capsule representing procedural signals emitted by a blockchain system during a defined time interval.

Because it preserves proportional relationships and observed temporal continuity, an InKe can be carried as a **structural reference** by external systems.

This may include artificial agents, automated processes, or other procedural systems.

Invarians does not define how an InKe should be used.
Any interpretation or operational objective exists outside the instrument.

## Why Invarians is not invariant detection

Invariant detection focuses on identifying rules, assertions, or conditions that must hold within a system.
It is evaluative, often normative, and tied to internal correctness.

Invarians does something fundamentally different.

Invariant detection attempts to explain or validate a system.
Invarians preserves structural context so that other systems can remain oriented over time.

It does not judge correctness.
It does not assert validity.
It does not detect violations.

It exposes continuity.

---

## Structural context and drift

When structural context is transient or absent, systems drift into narrative continuity.
Signals remain present, but their proportions and temporal relationships are lost.

Invarians exists to preserve that context across time and scale.

---

## Integration posture

Invarians exposes structural compatibility, not operational behavior.

External systems may carry invariant context.
Invarians does not guide their reactions.

---

## Limitations

Observed time is procedural, not physical.
Precision is bounded and explicit.
Structural choices are assumed, not hidden.

---

## Availability

Invarians is deployed progressively across multiple blockchain environments.

- Active: Solana
- Upcoming: Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot, IOTA

Public access currently exposes a partial observatory surface.
Professional access is not yet open.

No operational service is offered at this stage.

## License and usage

This repository documents the Invarians instrument.

No guarantee of fitness, correctness, or applicability is provided.
Use of exposed concepts or structures is entirely external to the instrument.
